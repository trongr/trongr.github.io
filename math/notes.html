<h1>Learning and Problem Solving Notes</h1>

<h1>General Rules</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Ask questions. There are no bad questions. Asking stupid questions will
    lead to asking smart questions.</li>
    <li>Try new things. Try old things differently.</li>
    <li>Constantly make choices. Decide. Take action. It is better to act, make
    mistakes, and fix them than to sit and do nothing.</li>
    <li>Note specific things. Everything is in the details. Note how the details
    fit into the big picture.</li>
    <li>Take notes. Writing things down makes nebulous ideas seem more real.</li>
    <li>Make everything explicit and concrete.</li>
    <li>Try and see if you can apply what you've just learned.</li>
    <li>Look things up. One thing will lead to another, and it'll all come around.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to time and how you're spending it. Measure your progress.
    Maximize time actually doing things instead of spinning your wheels.</li>
    <li>Review and reorganize.</li>
    <li>Make it fun and interesting. Add variety.</li>
    <li>Don't listen to music when you're reading, writing or thinking deeply.
    Listen to music when you're performing mechanical / automatic activities
    that don't require a lot of concentration.
    </li>
    <li>Just keep learning. Things will figure themselves out.</li>    
</ol>
