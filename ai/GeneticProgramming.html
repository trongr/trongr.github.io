<h1>Genetic Programming: Overview</h1>

<h2>A genetic algorithm</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Randomly generate a collection of chromosomes, called the population.</li>
  <li>Evaluate each chromosome in the population to determine fitness.</li>
  <li>Based on the fitness, select members of the population that will be used
  to create the next generation of the population, i.e. selecting who will get
  to breed children. One strategy for creating children is called recombination,
  or crossover, where a child is created by combining the genes of the two
  parents.</li>
  <li>Mutate some parents and offspring.</li>
  <li>Form new population from mutated parents and offspring.</li>
  <li>Optional: promote some unaltered parents from to the next generation. This
  process is called Elitism.</li>
  <li>Repeat as required (until max number of generation or fitness is
  acceptable).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bloat</h2>

<p>
  As a population evolves over time, the chromosomes may grow in size without
  improving fitness. This is similar to how real software becomes bloated over
  time as you add more and more code to a project. Productivity stagnates
  because the system has to overcome friction created by old code, e.g. it's
  hard to remove old legacy code, data has to flow through more and more code in
  order to get from input to output, etc.
