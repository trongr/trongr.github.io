<h1>Iterative generative workflow</h1>

<p>
    Given what the Face GAN can do [taking in an encoding and turning it into
    learned faces], we can create a tool that lets you iteratively build a
    likeness from scratch. First have the model generate a random set of faces,
    then choose from among those which ones are most similar to the one you have
    in mind. Then have the network perturb that face's encoding slightly to
    generate faces similar to that. Finally choose among those the one most
    similar to your target face, and repeat.
</p>

<h1>Dynamic iterative generative models</h1>

<p>
    This process of generating similar things and iteratively approaching your
    desired solution is very powerful. We can apply it to other things, e.g.
    building design: we can have a model generating a set of random buildings,
    then you pick one and it'll generate buildings similar to that, and so on
    and so on. The one prerequisite is that the model has to contain the whole
    space of potential solutions. How can you create a model that doesn't know
    all solutions, but can explore them on the fly, just like a human?
