    We can also think of $E$ as the force experienced by each unit
    charge contained in the test charge:

    $$E(r) = \frac{F_1(r)}{1},$$

    kinda like how acceleration is the force per unit
    mass. E.g. compare the electric field

    $$E = \frac{KQ}{r^2}$$

    generated by a point charge with the acceleration due to a mass $M$:

    $$a = \frac{GM}{r^2}.$$

<h1>Dipoles</h1>

<h2>Inverse Cube Law for Dipoles and Magnetic Fields</h2>

<p>
    <b>Theorem: Inverse Cube Law for Dipoles.</b> <i>The electric
    field of a dipole varies inversely as the distance cubed: $$F
    \propto \frac{Xx}{R^3}.$$</i>
</p>

<div class="bside">
    <b>Question.</b> What happens when they aren't?
</div>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> For simplicity assume the dipole and the test charge
    are aligned horizontally,* so let the charge configuration be as follows:
</p>

<img src="images/inversecubedipole.png">

<p>
    Then the force acting on $X$ is

    $$F = \frac{KXx}{(R - \frac{\delta}{2})^2} - \frac{KXx}{(R + \frac{\delta}{2})^2}
    = \frac{KXx}{R^2(1 - \frac{\delta}{2R})^2} - \frac{KXx}{R^2(1 + \frac{\delta}{2R})^2}.$$

    To simplify this expression we'll use the
    Binomial Approximation, which says that if $x$ is a small number
    close to 0 and $\alpha$ is a real number, then

    $$(1 + x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x.$$

    Applying this to the denominator, we get

    $$\left(1 \pm \frac{\delta}{2R}\right)^{-2} \approx 1 \mp \frac{\delta}{R}.$$
</p>

<p>
    Now $F$ simplifies to

    $$F \approx \frac{KXx}{R^2}\left(1 + \frac{\delta}{R}\right)
    - \frac{KXx}{R^2}\left(1 - \frac{\delta}{R}\right)
    = \frac{2\delta KXx}{R^3}.$$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remark.</b> Actually, instead of using the Binomial
    Approximation there's a sligthly easier way to get the same result
    that also gives you a better feeling for the estimate---by simple
    algebraic manipulation:

    $$F = KXx \left[\frac{1}{(R - \frac{\delta}{2})^2} - \frac{1}{(R + \frac{\delta}{2})^2}\right]
    = KXx \frac{2R\d}{(R - \frac{\d}{2})^2 (R + \frac{\d}{2})^2}.$$

    Since $R \gg \d,$ the denominator is approximately $R^4,$ so this becomes

    $$F \approx \frac{2\delta KXx}{R^3}.$$
</p>

<div class="box">
    <b>Aside.</b> Once we calculated that the field of a dipole varied
    inversely as the distance cubed when the test charge was along the
    dipole, it's fairly obvious that it should also vary inversely as
    the distance cubed no matter where the test charge is---provided
    it's sufficiently far away---because if you're far away the
    dipoles will look like a single point charge.
</div>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/inversecubedipoleknight.png">
    <b>Notation.</b> We'll switch notations to refer to this drawing.
</div>

<p>
    Now we'll do the same for the case when the test charge is in the
    plane bisecting the dipole.
</p>

<p>
    First note that along $R,$ the field is zero because the $+q$
    charge pushes $Q$ away, while $-q$ pulls it towards the
    dipole. Therefore the field at $Q$ is only along the $y$-axis,
    specifically towards the negative $y$-axis:

    \begin{align*}
    F &= \frac{KQq}{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}
         \frac{s/2}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}}
       + \frac{KQq}{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}
         \frac{s/2}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}} \\
      &= \frac{KQqs}{\left( R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2 \right)^{3/2}}.
    \end{align*}

    Since $R \gg s,$ again the denominator is approximately $R^3,$ so

    $$F \approx \frac{KQqs}{R^3}$$

    in the negative $y$ direction. Note also that this is half the
    force when the test charge was along the dipole axis.
</p>

<p>
    One final observation is that when $R \gg s,$ the field line is
    roughly parallel to the line away from the dipole, which tells us
    a little bit about the general case when the test charge is not
    along the axes:
</p>

<p class="box">
    <b>Question.</b> <i>Formula for the general case? Must depend on
    the angle and be somewhere between

    $$\frac{2KQqs}{R^3} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{KQqs}{R^3}.$$</i>

    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>Since magnets are always dipoles, magnetic
    fields also vary inversely as the distance cubed.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Example: atomic dipole.</b> An atom in an electric field
    becomes a dipole since electrons will want to spend more time "up
    stream" than "down stream". (By convention upstream refers to the
    positive source charge.)

<h1>Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution</h1>

<h2>Linear, Surface, and Volumetric Charge Density</h2>

<p>
    <b>Definition.</b> <i>Let $L$ be the length of a one dimensional
    object $M$ of uniform charge $Q.$ Then the linear charge density
    of $M$ is defined to be

    $$\l \equiv \frac{Q}{L}.$$

    Surface and volume charge densities $\h$ and $\r$ are defined
    ananlogously.</i>
</p>

<h2>Example. Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Rod</h2>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/thinroduniformcharge.png">
</div>

<p>
    Assume that the test charge is a distance $r$ away, and exactly
    half way between the rod end points. A tiny slice of the rod has
    length $dy$ and charge $\l dy,$ so its field on the test charge is

    $$dE = \frac{K\l dy}{r^2 + y^2} \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2 + y^2}},$$

    and the total field is

    \begin{align*}
      E = \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{K\l r dy}{\left( r^2 + y^2 \right)^{3/2}}
        = \left.\frac{K\l r y}{r^2\sqrt{r^2 + y^2}}\right|_{-L/2}^{L/2}
        = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}},
    \end{align*}

    which simplifies to

<div class="box">
    $$E = \frac{KQ}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}}.$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remark.</b> To calculate the field for an infinite uniformly
    charged rod of charge density $\l,$ in the second last step we can
    take $L \longrightarrow \infty:$

<div class="box">
    $$E = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}} = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{(r/L)^2 + (1/2)^2}L}
        \longrightarrow \frac{2K\l}{r}.$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note.</b> The field for an infinitely long wire varies as
    $1/r,$ whereas that of a finite wire varies as $1/r^2.$

    <img src="images/ringcharge.png">
</div>

<h2>Example. Uniformly Charged Ring</h2>

<p>
    Remember the ring has no width: it's just the perimeter of a
    circle. Let

    $$\l = Q / 2\p R$$

    be the linear charge density along
    the ring. Then similar to the previous example an infinitesimal
    arc has length $R d\th$ and charge $\l R d\th,$ so its field is

    $$dE = \frac{K\l R z d\th}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}.$$

    Therefore the total field of the ring is

<div class="box">
    $$E = \int_0^{2\p} \frac{K\l R z d\th}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
        = \frac{K\l R z 2\p}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
        = \frac{KQz}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}.$$
</div>
</p>

<div class="aside">
    This graph reminds me of activation functions in Machine
    Learning. Gotta remember this if you need to use some similar
    looking function, and if you wanna implement it physically, now
    you know what to use: a uniformly charged ring!

    <img src="images/ringchargeactivation2.png">
    <img src="images/ringchargeactivation.png">
</div>

<p>
    Note that for $z \gg R,$

    $$E \longrightarrow \frac{KQ}{z^2},$$

    so the ring acts like a point charge at long distances, at least
    along the main axis.

</p>

<p>
    Finally plotting $E$ as a function of $z$ shows that it's zero at
    the center of the ring, as we expect, and since we already know
    that the field gets weaker with distance, it must peak somewhere
    in between, which I hadn't expected!
</p>

<h2>Example. Uniformly Charged Disk and Infinite Uniformly Charged Plane</h2>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/uniformlychargeddisk.png">
</div>

<p>
    First we'll calculate the field for a ring on the disk, then
    integrate that over $r.$ Let $\h$ be the charge density of the
    disk, $dr$ be the infinitesimal width of the ring and $r$ be its
    radius. Then the ring has area $2\p r dr$ and charge

    $$\h 2\p r dr.$$

    By the previous uniform ring example, its field on a test charge
    at distance $z$ is

    $$dE = \frac{K2\p\h r dr z}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}.$$

    Summing this over all the rings yields the field for the entire
    disk:

    \begin{align*}
    E &= \int_0^R \frac{K2\p\h r z dr}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} \\
      &= - \left.\frac{2\p\h K z}{\sqrt{r^2 + z^2}}\right|_0^R \\
      &= - \frac{2\p \h K z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} + \frac{2\p \h K z}{\sqrt{z^2}} \\
      &= 2\p \h K \left[1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}\right].
    \end{align*}

    In the last step we assumed $z > 0$ to simplify the expression. If
    $z < 0,$ $E$ would have the same magnitude but reverse
    direction.
</p>

<div class="aside">
    <a href="images/algebraicsigmoid.png" target="_blank">A sigmoid
    function!</a>
</div>

<p>
    The situation when $z \longrightarrow 0$ is a little
    unexpected: since

    $$\frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(R/z)^2 + 1}}
        \longrightarrow 0,$$

    we have

    $$E \longrightarrow 2\p\h K,$$

    a constant independent of $z,$ as long as $z > 0!$
</p>

<p>
    An alternative formulation gives us the field for an infinite
    plane: if instead of taking $z\longrightarrow 0$ we take
    $R\longrightarrow \infty,$ then the field is constant and equal to

<div class="box">
    $$E = 2\p\h K = \frac{\h}{2\e},$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    regardless of where you are above it.
</p>

<div class="aside">
    Infinite uniformly charged plate.
    <img src="images/infiniteplate.png">
</div>

<p>
    Another surprise is that at $z = 0,$ the field suddenly drops to
    0! This is because in the second step where we calculated the
    field of a ring,

    $$dE = \frac{K2\p\h r dr z}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} = 0.$$

    Plus it's also obvious by symmetry.
</p>

<p>
    At the other end, as $z\longrightarrow\infty,$

    $$E = 2\p \h K \left[1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}\right]
        \longrightarrow 0,$$

    as we expect. But, we'd like to know a little more about how fast
    $E$ changes with respect to $z.$ Recall the binomial approximation:

    $$(1 + x)^\a \approx 1 + \a x$$

    for $x$ close to 0, and apply it to

    $$\frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} = \left(1 + (R/z)^2\right)^{-1/2} \approx 1 - \frac{R^2}{2z^2}.$$

    And so
<div class="box">
    $$E \approx 2\p \h K \left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{R^2}{2z^2} \right)\right]
        = \frac{\pi\h K R^2}{z^2} = \frac{KQ}{z^2}.$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    Therefore $E$ varies as $1/z^2$ for $z \gg R,$ i.e. the uniformly
    charged disk acts like a point charge far away.
</p>

<img src="images/Alpha-Centauri-cropped.jpg">

<div class="aside">
<p>
    Now that we've seen how a field can vary with distance as

    $$r^{-1}, r^{-2}, r^{-3},\ldots$$

    I'm starting to see why the gravitational and electrical forces
    vary as $r^{-2}.$ It's the result of some local
    geometry---analogous to the geometries of the wire, ring, disk,
    infinite plate, dipole, etc.---at a very small scale, extending to
    huge distances as $r\longrightarrow \infty.$ If we wanna
    know <i>why</i> gravity varies as $r^{-2},$ we need to go down to
    the very bottom and see what it's doing down there.
</p>

<p>
    That's kinda obvious now that I said it out loud.
</p>

<img src="images/no_shit.png">

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>Gravity won't suddenly change its variability
    as you go farther out, e.g. the Sun's gravity won't start
    decreasing as $r^{-4}$ when you fly all the way out to Alpha
    Centauri.</i>
</p>
</div>

<h2>Parallel Plate Capacitor</h2>

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>If you had two parallel infinite
    plates---instead of one---of opposite and equal charge densities,
    the electric field between the two plates would be twice as big:

    $$E = 4\pi \h K = \frac{\h}{\e}.$$

    Beyond those plates the field is zero because the plates cancel
    each other out.</i>
