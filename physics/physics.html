<h2>Insulators and Conductors</h2>

<p>
    The third prong of the plug in electrical sockets connect to a
    wire that runs deep into the ground somewhere outside the
    building, thus grounding the appliance. Didn't know that!

<h1>Coulomb's Law</h1>

<p>
    <b>Coulomb's Inverse Square Law.</b> <i>Two charges Q and q a
    distance r apart exert a force on each other with magnitude

    $$F = \frac{K|Qq|}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\e_0} \frac{|Qq|}{r^2}$$

    where K is Coulomb's constant and $\e_0$ is the permittivity
    constant.</i>

    <b>Question.</b> <i>Why inverse square?</i>

<h1>Electric Field</h1>

<p>
    <b>Definition.</b> <i>The electric field at a point $r$ is

    $$E(r) = \frac{F_q(r)}{q} \sim N/C$$

    where $F_q(r)$ is the electric force on any test charge q at
    $r$.</i>
</p>

<p>
    We can also think of $E$ as the force experienced by each unit
    charge contained in the test charge:

    $$E(r) = \frac{F_1(r)}{1},$$

    kinda like how acceleration is the force per unit
    mass. E.g. compare the electric field

    $$E = \frac{KQ}{r^2}$$

    generated by a point charge with the acceleration due to a mass $M$:

    $$a = \frac{GM}{r^2}.$$

<h1>Dipoles</h1>

<h2>Inverse Cube Law for Dipoles and Magnetic Fields</h2>

<p>
    <b>Theorem: Inverse Cube Law for Dipoles.</b> <i>The electric
    field of a dipole varies inversely as the distance cubed: $$F
    \propto \frac{Xx}{R^3}.$$</i>
</p>

<div class="aside">
    <b>Question.</b> What happens when they aren't?
</div>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> For simplicity assume the dipole and the test charge
    are aligned horizontally,* so let the charge configuration be as follows:
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="images/inversecubedipole.png">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Then the force acting on $X$ is

    $$F = \frac{KXx}{(R - \frac{\delta}{2})^2} - \frac{KXx}{(R + \frac{\delta}{2})^2}
    = \frac{KXx}{R^2(1 - \frac{\delta}{2R})^2} - \frac{KXx}{R^2(1 + \frac{\delta}{2R})^2}.$$

    To simplify this expression we'll use the
    Binomial Approximation, which says that if $x$ is a small number
    close to 0 and $\alpha$ is a real number, then

    $$(1 + x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x.$$

    Applying this to the denominator, we get

    $$\left(1 \pm \frac{\delta}{2R}\right)^{-2} \approx 1 \mp \frac{\delta}{R}.$$
</p>

<p>
    Now $F$ simplifies to

    $$F \approx \frac{KXx}{R^2}\left(1 + \frac{\delta}{R}\right)
    - \frac{KXx}{R^2}\left(1 - \frac{\delta}{R}\right)
    = \frac{2\delta KXx}{R^3}.$$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remark.</b> Actually, instead of using the Binomial
    Approximation there's a sligthly easier way to get the same result
    that also gives you a better feeling for the estimate---by simple
    algebraic manipulation:

    $$F = KXx \left[\frac{1}{(R - \frac{\delta}{2})^2} - \frac{1}{(R + \frac{\delta}{2})^2}\right]
    = KXx \frac{2R\d}{(R - \frac{\d}{2})^2 (R + \frac{\d}{2})^2}.$$

    Since $R \gg \d,$ the denominator is approximately $R^4,$ so this becomes

    $$F \approx \frac{2\delta KXx}{R^3}.$$
</p>

<p>
    Now we'll do the same for the case when the test charge is in the
    plane bisecting the dipole:
</p>

        <b>Notation.</b> We'll switch notations to refer to this drawing.
    </div>
</p>

<div class="box">
    <b>Aside.</b> Once we calculated that the field of a dipole varied
    inversely as the distance cubed when the test charge was along the
    dipole, it's fairly obvious that it should also vary inversely as
    the distance cubed no matter where the test charge is---provided
    it's sufficiently far away---because if you're far away the
    dipoles will look like a single point charge. But, we'll calculate
    it for this case anyway, for practice.
</div>

<p>
    First note that along $R,$ the field is zero because the $+q$
    charge pushes $Q$ away, while $-q$ pulls it towards the
    dipole. Therefore the field at $Q$ is only along the $y$-axis,
    specifically towards the negative $y$-axis:

    \begin{align*}
    F &= \frac{KQq}{R^2 + \left( \d/2 \right)^2}
         \frac{\d/2}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( \d/2 \right)^2}}
       + \frac{KQq}{R^2 + \left( \d/2 \right)^2}
         \frac{\d/2}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( \d/2 \right)^2}} \\
      &= \frac{KQq\d}{\left( R^2 + \left( \d/2 \right)^2 \right)^{3/2}}.
    \end{align*}

    Since $R \gg \d,$ again the denominator is approximately $R^3,$ so

    $$F \approx \frac{KQq\d}{R^3}$$

    in the negative $y$ direction. Note also that this is half the
    force when the test charge was along the dipole axis.
</p>

<p>
    One final observation is that when $R \gg \d,$ the field line is
    roughly parallel to the line away from the dipole, which tells us
    a little bit about the general case when the test charge is not
    along the axes:

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>Since magnets are always dipoles, magnetic
    fields also vary inversely as the distance cubed.</i>

    <b>Example: atomic dipole.</b> An atom in an electric field
    becomes a dipole since electrons will want to spend more time "up
    stream" than "down stream". (By convention an electric stream
    goes from positive to negative.)

<h1>Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution</h1>

<h2>Linear, Surface, and Volumetric Charge Density</h2>

<p>
    <b>Definition.</b> <i>Let $L$ be the length of a one dimensional
    object $M$ of uniform charge $Q.$ Then the linear charge density
    of $M$ is defined to be

    $$\l \equiv \frac{Q}{L}.$$

    Surface and volume charge densities $\h$ and $\r$ are defined
    ananlogously.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Example: electric field of a uniformly charged rod.</b> Assume
    that the test charge is a distance $r$ away, and exactly half way
    between the rod end points. A tiny slice of the rod has length
    $dy$ and charge $\l dy,$ so its field on the test charge is

    $$dE = \frac{K\l dy}{r^2 + y^2} \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2 + y^2}},$$

    and the total field is

    \begin{align*}
      E = \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{K\l r dy}{\left( r^2 + y^2 \right)^{3/2}}
        = \left.\frac{K\l r y}{r^2\sqrt{r^2 + y^2}}\right|_{-L/2}^{L/2}
        = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}},
    \end{align*}

    which simplifies to

    $$E = \frac{KQ}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}}.$$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remark.</b> To calculate the field for an infinite uniformly
    charged rod of charge density $\l,$ in the second last step we can
    take $L \longrightarrow \infty:$

    $$E = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}} = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{(r/L)^2 + (1/2)^2}L}
        \longrightarrow \frac{2K\l}{r}.$$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note.</b> The field for an infinitely long wire varies as
    $1/r,$ whereas that of a finite wire varies as $1/r^2.$

<h1>Gauss's Law</h1>



<h1>Infinite Uniformly Charged Plates</h1>

<p>
    <b>Proposition.</b> <i>The electric field of an infinite uniformly
    charged plate is constant and equal to $$E = 2 \pi K \sigma =
    \frac{\sigma}{2 \e},$$ where $\sigma$ is the charge density
    of the plate: the field is the same no matter where you are above
    the plate. Neat!</i>
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> There are two ways to show this, using either
    Gauss's Law or direct integration. TODO.

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>The electric field of an infinite uniformly
    charged plate with a hole at the origin is constant along the line
    above the origin.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Question.</b> <i>What does the rest of the field look like? Do
    the field lines converge towards the z-axis?</i>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>If you had two parallel plates---instead of
    one---of opposite and equal charge densities, the electric field
    between the two plates would be twice as big: $$E = \pi K \sigma =
    \frac{\sigma}{\e}.$$ Beyond those plates the field is zero
    because the plates cancel each other out.</i>
