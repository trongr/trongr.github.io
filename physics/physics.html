<h1>Dipoles</h1>

<h2>Inverse Cube Law for Dipoles and Magnetic Fields</h2>

<p>
    <b>Theorem: Inverse Cube Law for Dipoles.</b> <i>The electric
    field of a dipole varies inversely as the distance cubed: $$F
    \propto \frac{Xx}{R^3}.$$</i>
</p>

<div class="bside">
    <b>Question.</b> What happens when they aren't?---Ah, if they
    aren't at first they will be. That doesn't exactly answer the
    question but at least you know what ultimately
    happens. <a href="#fneorbqh347255">See the water bottle.</a>
</div>

<p>
    <i>Proof.</i> For simplicity assume the dipole and the test charge
    are aligned horizontally,<b>*</b> so let the charge configuration
    be as follows:
</p>

<img src="images/inversecubedipole.png">

<p>
    Then the force acting on $X$ is

    $$F = \frac{KXx}{(R - \frac{\delta}{2})^2} - \frac{KXx}{(R + \frac{\delta}{2})^2}
    = \frac{KXx}{R^2(1 - \frac{\delta}{2R})^2} - \frac{KXx}{R^2(1 + \frac{\delta}{2R})^2}.$$

    To simplify this expression we'll use the
    Binomial Approximation, which says that if $x$ is a small number
    close to 0 and $\alpha$ is a real number, then

    $$(1 + x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x.$$

    Applying this to the denominator, we get

    $$\left(1 \pm \frac{\delta}{2R}\right)^{-2} \approx 1 \mp \frac{\delta}{R}.$$
</p>

<p>
    Now $F$ simplifies to

    $$F \approx \frac{KXx}{R^2}\left(1 + \frac{\delta}{R}\right)
    - \frac{KXx}{R^2}\left(1 - \frac{\delta}{R}\right)
    = \frac{2\delta KXx}{R^3}.$$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remark.</b> Actually, instead of using the Binomial
    Approximation there's a sligthly easier way to get the same result
    that also gives you a better feeling for the estimate---by simple
    algebraic manipulation:

    $$F = KXx \left[\frac{1}{(R - \frac{\delta}{2})^2} - \frac{1}{(R + \frac{\delta}{2})^2}\right]
    = KXx \frac{2R\d}{(R - \frac{\d}{2})^2 (R + \frac{\d}{2})^2}.$$

    Since $R \gg \d,$ the denominator is approximately $R^4,$ so this becomes

    $$F \approx \frac{2\delta KXx}{R^3}.$$
</p>

<div class="box">
    <b>Aside.</b> Once we calculated that the field of a dipole varied
    inversely as the distance cubed when the test charge was along the
    dipole, it's fairly obvious that it should also vary inversely as
    the distance cubed no matter where the test charge is---provided
    it's sufficiently far away---because if you're far away the
    dipoles will look like a single point charge.
</div>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/inversecubedipoleknight.png">
    <b>Notation.</b> We'll switch notations to refer to this drawing.
</div>

<p>
    Now we'll do the same for the case when the test charge is in the
    plane bisecting the dipole.
</p>

<p>
    First note that along $R,$ the field is zero because the $+q$
    charge pushes $Q$ away, while $-q$ pulls it towards the
    dipole. Therefore the field at $Q$ is only along the $y$-axis,
    specifically towards the negative $y$-axis:

    \begin{align*}
    F &= \frac{KQq}{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}
         \frac{s/2}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}}
       + \frac{KQq}{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}
         \frac{s/2}{\sqrt{R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2}} \\
      &= \frac{KQqs}{\left( R^2 + \left( s/2 \right)^2 \right)^{3/2}}.
    \end{align*}

    Since $R \gg s,$ again the denominator is approximately $R^3,$ so

    $$F \approx \frac{KQqs}{R^3}$$

    in the negative $y$ direction. Note also that this is half the
    force when the test charge was along the dipole axis.
</p>

<p>
    One final observation is that when $R \gg s,$ the field line is
    roughly parallel to the line away from the dipole, which tells us
    a little bit about the general case when the test charge is not
    along the axes:
</p>

<p class="box">
    <b>Question.</b> <i>Formula for the general case? Must depend on
    the angle and be somewhere between

    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>Since magnets are always dipoles, magnetic
    fields also vary inversely as the distance cubed.</i>
</p>

<p>

    becomes a dipole since electrons will want to spend more time "up
    stream" than "down stream". (By convention upstream refers to the
    positive source charge.)

<h1>Electric Field of a Continuous Charge Distribution</h1>

<h2>Linear, Surface, and Volumetric Charge Density</h2>

<p>
    <b>Definition.</b> <i>Let $L$ be the length of a one dimensional
    object $M$ of uniform charge $Q.$ Then the linear charge density
    of $M$ is defined to be

    $$\l \equiv \frac{Q}{L}.$$

    Surface and volume charge densities $\h$ and $\r$ are defined
    ananlogously.</i>
</p>

<h2>Example. Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Rod</h2>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/thinroduniformcharge.png">
</div>

<p>
    Assume that the test charge is a distance $r$ away, and exactly
    half way between the rod end points. A tiny slice of the rod has
    length $dy$ and charge $\l dy,$ so its field on the test charge is

    $$dE = \frac{K\l dy}{r^2 + y^2} \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2 + y^2}},$$

    and the total field is

    \begin{align*}
      E = \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{K\l r dy}{\left( r^2 + y^2 \right)^{3/2}}
        = \left.\frac{K\l r y}{r^2\sqrt{r^2 + y^2}}\right|_{-L/2}^{L/2}
        = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}},
    \end{align*}

    which simplifies to

<div class="box">
    $$E = \frac{KQ}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}}.$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Remark.</b> To calculate the field for an infinite uniformly
    charged rod of charge density $\l,$ in the second last step we can
    take $L \longrightarrow \infty:$

<div class="box">
    $$E = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{r^2 + (L/2)^2}} = \frac{K\l L}{r\sqrt{(r/L)^2 + (1/2)^2}L}
        \longrightarrow \frac{2K\l}{r}.$$

    $1/r,$ whereas that of a finite wire varies as $1/r^2.$

<h2>Example. Uniformly Charged Ring</h2>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/ringcharge.png">
</div>

<p>
    Remember the ring has no width: it's just the perimeter of a
    circle. Let

    $$\l = Q / 2\p R$$

    be the linear charge density along
    the ring. Then similar to the previous example an infinitesimal
    arc has length $R d\th$ and charge $\l R d\th,$ so its field is

    $$dE = \frac{K\l R z d\th}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}.$$

    Therefore the total field of the ring is

<div class="box">
    $$E = \int_0^{2\p} \frac{K\l R z d\th}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
        = \frac{K\l R z 2\p}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
        = \frac{KQz}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}.$$
</div>
</p>

<div class="aside">
    This graph reminds me of activation functions in Machine
    Learning. Gotta remember this if you need to use some similar
    looking function, and if you wanna implement it physically, now
    you know what to use: a uniformly charged ring!

    <img src="images/ringchargeactivation2.png">
    <img src="images/ringchargeactivation.png">
</div>

<p>
    Note that for $z \gg R,$

    $$E \longrightarrow \frac{KQ}{z^2},$$

    so the ring acts like a point charge at long distances, at least
    along the main axis.

</p>

<p>
    Finally plotting $E$ as a function of $z$ shows that it's zero at
    the center of the ring, as we expect, and since we already know
    that the field gets weaker with distance, it must peak somewhere
    in between, which I hadn't expected!
</p>

<div class="clearboth"></div>

<div class="bside">
    <img src="images/ringofchargeoscillator.png">
</div>

<p>
    <b>Exercise.</b> The ring of charge has field

    $$E = \frac{KQz}{(R^2 + z^2)^{3/2}},$$

    so for $z \ll R,$ the force is

    $$F \approx \frac{KQqz}{R^3}.$$

    This is exactly Hooke's law for a spring with spring constant $k =
    \frac{KQq}{R^3},$ which we already know undergoes harmonic
    oscillation with frequency

    $$f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{KQq}{m R^3}}.$$
</p>

<h2>Example. Uniformly Charged Disk and Infinite Uniformly Charged Plane</h2>

<div class="aside">
    <img src="images/uniformlychargeddisk.png">
</div>

<p>
    First we'll calculate the field for a ring on the disk, then
    integrate that over $r.$ Let $\h$ be the charge density of the
    disk, $dr$ be the infinitesimal width of the ring and $r$ be its
    radius. Then the ring has area $2\p r dr$ and charge

    $$\h 2\p r dr.$$

    By the previous uniform ring example, its field on a test charge
    at distance $z$ is

    $$dE = \frac{K2\p\h r dr z}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}.$$

    Summing this over all the rings yields the field for the entire
    disk:

    \begin{align*}
    E &= \int_0^R \frac{K2\p\h r z dr}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}
       = - \left.\frac{2\p\h K z}{\sqrt{r^2 + z^2}}\right|_0^R \\
      &= - \frac{2\p \h K z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} + \frac{2\p \h K z}{\sqrt{z^2}} \\
      &= 2\p \h K \left[1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}\right].
    \end{align*}

    In the last step we assumed $z > 0$ to simplify the expression. If
    $z < 0,$ $E$ would have the same magnitude but reverse
    direction.
</p>

<div class="aside">
    A sigmoid function!
    <img src="images/algebraicsigmoid.png">
</div>

<p>
    The situation when $z \longrightarrow 0$ is a little
    unexpected: since

    $$\frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(R/z)^2 + 1}}
        \longrightarrow 0,$$

    we have

    $$E \longrightarrow 2\p\h K,$$

    a constant independent of $z,$ as long as $z > 0!$
</p>

<p>
    An alternative formulation gives us the field for an infinite
    plane: if instead of taking $z\longrightarrow 0$ we take
    $R\longrightarrow \infty,$ then the field is constant and equal to

<div class="box">
    $$E = 2\p\h K = \frac{\h}{2\e},$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    regardless of where you are above it.
</p>

<div class="aside">
    Infinite uniformly charged plate.
    <img src="images/infiniteplate.png">
</div>

<p>
    Another surprise is that at $z = 0,$ the field suddenly drops to
    0! This is because in the second step where we calculated the
    field of a ring,

    $$dE = \frac{K2\p\h r dr z}{(r^2 + z^2)^{3/2}} = 0.$$

    Plus it's also obvious by symmetry. Just kinda odd that nature
    allows such sharp jumps. But of course this isn't nature: in real
    life a test charge would never get to $z=0$---there'd be something
    in the way. Postulative speculations!
</p>

<p>
    At the other end, as $z\longrightarrow\infty,$

    $$E = 2\p \h K \left[1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}}\right]
        \longrightarrow 0,$$

    as we expect. But, we'd like to know a little more about how fast
    $E$ changes with respect to $z.$ Recall the binomial approximation:

    $$(1 + x)^\a \approx 1 + \a x$$

    for $x$ close to 0, and apply it to

    $$\frac{z}{\sqrt{R^2 + z^2}} = \left(1 + (R/z)^2\right)^{-1/2} \approx 1 - \frac{R^2}{2z^2}.$$

    And so
<div class="box">
    $$E \approx 2\p \h K \left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{R^2}{2z^2} \right)\right]
        = \frac{\pi\h K R^2}{z^2} = \frac{KQ}{z^2}.$$
</div>
</p>

<p>
    Therefore $E$ varies as $1/z^2$ for $z \gg R,$ i.e. the uniformly
    charged disk acts like a point charge far away.
</p>

<div class="aside">
<p>
    Now that we've seen how a field can vary with distance as

    $$r^{-1}, r^{-2}, r^{-3},\ldots$$

    I'm starting to see why the gravitational and electrical forces
    vary as $r^{-2}.$ It's the result of some local
    geometry---analogous to the geometries of the wire, ring, disk,
    infinite plate, dipole, etc.---at a very small scale, extending to
    huge distances as $r\longrightarrow \infty.$ If we wanna
    know <i>why</i> gravity varies as $r^{-2},$ we need to go down to
    the very bottom and see what it's doing down there.
</p>

<p>
    That's kinda obvious huh.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>Gravity won't suddenly change its variability
    as you go farther out, e.g. the Sun's gravity won't start
    decreasing as $r^{-4}$ when you fly all the way out to Alpha
    Centauri.</i>

    <b>Question.</b> <i>Why is an iron filing's dipole axis always

</p>
<p>
    Maybe it's kinda like how a half filled bottle always floats with
    the length vertical. When there's no gravity, the positive water
    and the negative air in the bottle can be in any arrangement. But
    once you introduce a force field, the water will be pushed down
    stream, and the water in turn pushes one end of the bottle to
    align it vertically:
</p>
    <img src="images/waterbottledipole.png">
</div>

<p>
    There is no net force on a dipole in a (globally---what about
    locally?) uniform electric field, because the positive end is
    pushed down stream, while the negative end is pulled up stream.
</p>

<p>
    The torque on the dipole is due to the two forces $F = qE$ on the
    two ends of the dipole. Therefore

    \begin{align*}
    \t = 2dF &= 2 (\tfrac{1}{2} s \sin \th) qE \\
             &= qs E \sin \th \\
             &= p E \sin \th \\
             &= p \times E,

    where $p \def qs$ is called the dipole moment. (The torque as

    where $\th$ is the angle between $E$ and $A.$</i>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Definition.</b> <i>The flux of an arbitrary electric field $E$
    through any surface $A$ is

    $$\F = \int_A E \cdot dA.$$ If $A$ is a closed surface we use a
    different symbol that means the same thing:

    $$\F = \oint_A E \cdot dA.$$</i>
</p>

<div class="bside">
    <b>*</b> Actually this is not quite rigorous, cause we're
    confusing a vector $E$ with its magnitude. A better way is to
    consider $E$ and $dA$ as actual vectors, and $E \cdot dA = E_1
    dA_1 + E_2 dA_2 + E_3 dA_3$ as a real-valued function on $A:$

    \begin{align*}
    \F &= \oint_A E \cdot dA \quad\text{(integral of a real function)}\\
        &= E \cdot dA \int_A 1 \\
        &= |E||dA| \cos \th \ A \\
        &= |E| \cos \th \ A.
    \end{align*}
</div>

<p>
    <b>Example.</b> If the field is constant on the surface, so that
    the magnitude $E$ and $\th$ are both constant, then we can move $E
    \cos \th$ out of the integral:<b>*</b>

    $$\F = \int_A E \cos \th\ dA = E \cos \th \int_A dA = E A \cos \th,$$

    which is the same as for the flat surface. In particular, if the
    field is tangent to the surface, i.e. it's perpendicular to the
    normal of $A,$ so that $\cos \th = 0,$ then

    $$\F = 0.$$

    On the other hand, if the field is perpendicular to $A,$
    i.e. parallel to the normal, then $\cos \th = 1$ and

    $$\F = EA.$$

<h3>Cylindrical flux</h3>

<div class="bside">
    <img src="images/gaussiancylinder.png">
</div>
<p>
    <b>Example.</b> The flux of a field with cylindrical symmetry
    through a cylinder with the same symmetry is

    $$\F = E_R A = 2\pi RL E_R,$$

    where $R$ and $L$ are the radius and length of the cylinder.
</p>

<h3>Spherical flux</h3>

<div class="bside">
    <b>*</b> The amount of water flowing through any circle is the
    same regardless of the radius.
    <img src="images/f65bd922a787ccd4a1fc35bb1879070e.jpg">
</div>
<p>
    <b>Example.</b> The flux of a field with spherical symmetry
    through a sphere with the same symmetry is

    $$\F = E_R A = 4\pi R^2 E_R,$$

    where $R$ is the radius of the sphere and $E_R$ is the field
    there. E.g. if the field is that of a point charge $q,$ then

    $$\F = 4\pi R^2 \frac{q}{4\pi \e R^2} = \frac{q}{\e}.$$

    In other words, the flux through a sphere around a point charge is
    independent of the radius.<b>*</b> Makes sense for a static field, one
    that doesn't change with time. I wonder if there's a time-variant
    version, e.g. if the charge pulses in time.
</p>

<div class="bside">

<p>
    In fact, we can generalize this a bit further: the flux of a point
    charge through any spherical sector is independent of the
    radius.
</p>

<h3>Flux through a gaussian surface containing a single charge</h3>

<p>
    Furthermore, since any closed surface can be approximated by many
    spherical sectors, we have:
</p>

<p>
    <b>Corollary.</b> <i>The flux through any gaussian surface
    containing a single charge is

    $$\F = \frac{q}{\e}.$$</i>
</p>

<h3>Flux through a gaussian surface containing no charge</h3>

<p>
    <b>Lemma.</b> <i>On the other hand, if a gaussian surface contains
    no charge then the net flux through the surface is zero, because
    everything flowing in has to flow out.</i>
</p>

<h3>Gauss's Law</h3>

<p>
    Combining the previous two results and using the principle of
    superposition, we have:
</p>

<p>
    <b>Theorem.</b> <i>Let $q_1,\ldots,q_n$ be charges with fields
    $E_1,\ldots,E_n,$ and let $A$ be a gaussian surface. Then the flux
    through $A$ due to those charges is

    <!-- use \vphantom to help vertically align underbrace texts -->
    \begin{align*}
    \F = \oint_A E \cdot dA &= \oint_A (E_1 + \cdots + E_n) \cdot dA \\
        &= \oint_A E_1 \cdot dA + \cdots + \oint_A E_n \cdot dA \\
        &= \underbrace{\frac{q_i}{\e} + \cdots + \frac{q_j}{\e}}_\text{charges inside $A$}
            + \underbrace{0 + \cdots + 0 \vphantom{\frac{}{}}}_\text{charges outside $A$}
    \end{align*}</i>
</p>

<p>
    If we define $Q = q_i + \cdots + q_j$ to be the total charges inside $A,$ we can write:
</p>

<p class="box yellow">
    $$\F = \frac{Q}{\e}.$$
</p>

<p>
    <b>Question.</b> This works for finitely many discrete
    charges. What about continuous charges? By the water analogy, it
    should still be true, e.g. instead of a water faucet (a point
    charge) imagine a sprinkler-like device or a long pipe with cracks
    all along its length (line of charge).
