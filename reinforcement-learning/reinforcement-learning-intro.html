<h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>

<h2>Action, observation, reward, history, and state</h2>

<p>
  <i>Definition. Action $ a_t, $ observation $ o_t, $ reward $ r_t. $ History is
  a tuple $ (a_1, o_1, r_1, \ldots, a_t, o_t, r_t). $ The agent has a model of
  the world, which is a function of the history: $ s_t = f(h_t). $</i>
</p>

<h2>How the world changes: deterministic v.s. stochastic</h2>

<p>
  In a deterministic world, given a history, each action maps to a single world
  state, observation, and possible reward. In a stochastic world, given a
  history, an action may lead to one of many possible futures; we model this
  uncertainty by defining a probability distribution on these futures.
</p>

<p>
  Deterministic systems are often modeled as stochastic because we don't have a
  good enough deterministic model for them, e.g. flipping a coin is
  deterministic: if you know the starting position and velocity of the coin, the
  type of coin, the type of floor it lands on, etc., and the dynamics of
  coin-flipping, you can predict with 100% certainty whether it will be head or
  tail. Nobody has done it because it's hard.

<h2>Exploitation v.s. exploration</h2>

<p>
  Performance v.s. practice.
