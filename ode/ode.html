<h1>Differential Equations</h1>

<h3>Model of a falling object</h3>
<div class="bside">
    Direction / slope field. Equilibrium solution corresponds to
    terminal velocity.
    <img src="images/fallingobject.png">
</div>
<p>
    <b>Example.</b> By Newton's second law,

    $$F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - \g v,$$

    where $\g v$ is an approximation of the force due to air drag.
</p>

<h3>Simple model of population growth</h3>
<div class="bside">
    $r = 0.5, d = 450.$
    <img src="images/fieldmice.png">
</div>
<p>
    <b>Example.</b> Let $p$ be a mice population, $r$ be the constant
    growth rate, and $d$ be the constant number of deaths due to owls
    per unit time (e.g. month):

    $$\dot p = rp - d.$$
</p>

<h3>Phase spaces of various systems</h3>

<p>
    <b>Example.</b> The phase space of the motion of a system of $n$
    points is described by the 3 position and 3 velocity coordinates,
    for a total of $6n$ dimensions. The phase space of a system of $n$
    rigid bodies has dimension $12n,$ because a rigid body's states
    are determined by the position and velocity (6) of its center and
    the position and velocity (6) of any second point on the
    body.
</p>

<h3>Solving a first-order linear equation by integrating factors</h3>

<p>
    The differential equation

    $$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t)$$

    is called linear if $f(x, t)$ has the form $a(t) x + b(t).$
</p>
<p>
    <i>E.g. solve $$\frac{dx}{dt} + 2tx = t$$ subject to $x = 1$ when $t=0.$</i>
</p>
<p>
    Multiply both sides by $e^{t^2}$:

    \begin{align*}
    e^{t^2} \frac{dx}{dt} + e^{t^2} 2tx &= e^{t^2} t \\
    \frac{d}{dt} (e^{t^2} x) &= e^{t^2} t \\
    e^{t^2} x &= \int e^{t^2} t dt \\
              &= \frac{e^{t^2}}{2} + c. \\
    \end{align*}

    Apply initial condition to find

    $$c = 1/2,$$

    and

    $$x = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{e^{-t^2}}{2}.$$
</p>

<h3>Solving a first order nonlinear separable equation</h3>

<p>
    <b>Ex.</b> <i>Solve $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x^2}{1 + t}$$ subject to $x = 1$ when $t = 0.$</i>
</p>

<p>
    A first order nonlinear equation is called separable if it has the form

    $$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t) = g(x) h(t).$$ Then we can write

    \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{g(x)} \frac{dx}{dt} &= h(t) \\
    \int \frac{1}{g(x)} dx &= \int h(t) dt. \\
    \end{align*}

    All that's left is to calculate these integrals, which in this case we can:

    \begin{align*}
    \int \frac{1}{x^2} dx &= \int \frac{1}{1 + t} dt \\
    x &= \frac{1}{c - \log(1 + t)}. \\
    \end{align*}

    Apply initial conditions to get

    $$x = \frac{1}{1 - \log(1 + t)}.$$
</p>

<h3>Solving a second order linear homogeneous equation knowing one solution</h3>

<p>
    <i>Ex. Consider the equation

        $$a \ddot x + b \dot x + cx = 0,$$

        where $a, b, c$ are known functions of $t.$ Suppose that we have found
        one solution, say $x = x_1(t),$ but have difficulty finding another.
        Show that by writing $x = x_1(t) u(t)$ we may reduce the equation to a
        first order problem for the variable $z = \dot u.$ Use this method to
        solve

        $$\ddot x - 2 \dot x + x = 0$$

        subject to $x = 1, \dot x = 0$ when $t = 0.$
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    Suppose that the second solution $x$ of this equation may be written in the
    form $x = x_1(t) u(t)$ for some $u$ (it might not). Then we can find $\dot
    x$ and $\ddot x$:

    \begin{align*}
        \dot x &= \dot x_1 u + x_1 \dot u \\
        \ddot x &= \ddot x_1 u + 2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u.
    \end{align*}

    Substituting these into the differential equation, we get

    \begin{align*}
    0 &= a \ddot x + b \dot x + cx \\
    &= a (\ddot x_1 u + 2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u) + b(\dot x_1 u + x_1 \dot u) + c x_1 u \\
    &= (a \ddot x_1 + b \dot x_1 + c x_1) u + a (2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u) + b x_1 \dot u \\
    &= a (2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u) + b x_1 \dot u \\
    &= a x_1 \ddot u + (a 2 \dot x_1 + b x_1) \dot u \\
    &= a x_1 \dot z + (a 2 \dot x_1 + b x_1) z. \\
    \end{align*}

    Depending on what $x_1$ is, this equation may easily be solved.
</p>
<p>
    Applying this method to

    $$\ddot x - 2 \dot x + x = 0,$$

    we want to solve

    \begin{align*}
    0 &= a x_1 \dot z + (a 2 \dot x_1 + b x_1) z \\
    &= e^t \dot z + (2 e^t - 2 e^t) z \\
    &= e^t \dot z.
    \end{align*}

    Therefore $z = k$ and $u(t) = kt$ for some constant $k.$ Finally,

    $$x = x_1(t) u(t) = k e^t t$$

    is the second solution.
</p>
<p>
    <i>A common theme in solving higher order differential equations is to
    reduce them to lower order equations that we know how to solve. Also a
    common problem solving technique.</i>
</p>

<h3>Nonhomogeneous second order linear equation</h3>

<p>
    <i>Ex. Solve $$\ddot x - x = t$$ s.t. $x = 1, \dot x = 0$ when $t = 0.$</i>
</p>
<p>
    We can solve a nonhomogeneous equation by finding (guessing) a particular
    solution, and adding it to the general solution of the homogeneous eq.
    In this case a particular solution is

    $$x_1 = e^t - t.$$

    The general solution to the homogeneous eq is known to be

    $$x = C e^t + D e^{-t}.$$

    Therefore the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is

    $$x = C e^t + D e^{-t} + e^t - t.$$

    Applying initial conditions we find that $C = D = 0,$ so the solution is

    $$x = e^t - t.$$

    (We could've skipped all this by noting that $x_1$ satisfied the initial
    conditions as soon as we found it.)
</p>

<h3>Simple harmonic motion</h3>

<p>
    Let

    $$m \ddot x + \a x = 0$$

    be the equation of motion for a linear spring with $x = x_0, \dot x = 0$
    when $t = 0.$ (this can be derived using Newton and Hooke's law). Following
    discussion in the book we have

    $$\pm \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{\frac{\a}{m}(x_0^2 - x^2)}} = t.$$

    The integral can be found by substituting $\sin \theta = x$ to get

    $$x = x_0 \sin(\sqrt{\tfrac{\a}{m}} t + \tfrac{\pi}{2}).$$

    Using a sum of sine formula, we get

    $$x = x_0 \cos \sqrt{\tfrac{\a}{m}} t.$$
