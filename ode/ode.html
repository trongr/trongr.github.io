<h1>Differential Equations</h1>

<!-- <img src="images/tumblr_o6goow949B1rtjm0mo1_500.gif">
<p class="quote">The results of mathematics are seldom directly
applied; it is the definitions that are really useful. Once you learn
the concept of a differential equation, you see differential equations
all over, no matter what you do. This you cannot see unless you take a
course in abstract differential equations. What applies is the
cultural background you get from a course in differential equations,
not the specific theorems. If you want to learn French, you have to
live the life of France, not just memorize thousands of words. If you
want to apply mathematics, you have to live the life of differential
equations. When you live this life, you can then go back to molecular
biology with a new set of eyes that will see things you could not
otherwise see.</p><hr>

    No. Reminds me of another puzzle where you walk up a mountain at
    dawn one day, and the next day also at dawn you walk
    down. Question is whether at some point on the second day you'll
    be at the same place at the same time as on the first day. Answer
    is Yes.

<h3>Model of a falling object</h3>

</div>
<p>
    <b>Example.</b> By Newton's second law,

    $$F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - \g v,$$

    where $\g v$ is an approximation of the force due to air drag.

<h3>Simple model of population growth</h3>

<p>
    <b>Example.</b> Let $p$ be a mice population, $r$ be the constant
    growth rate, and $d$ be the constant number of deaths due to owls
    per unit time (e.g. month):

    $$\dot p = rp - d.$$

<h3>Phase spaces of various systems</h3>

<p>
    <b>Example.</b> The phase space of the motion of a system of $n$
    points is described by the 3 position and 3 velocity coordinates,
    for a total of $6n$ dimensions. The phase space of a system of $n$
    rigid bodies has dimension $12n,$ because a rigid body's states
    are determined by the position and velocity (6) of its center and
    the position and velocity (6) of any second point on the
    body.

<h3>Solving a first-order linear equation by integrating factors</h3>

<p>
    The differential equation

    $$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t)$$

    is called linear if $f(x, t)$ has the form $a(t) x + b(t).$
</p>
<p>
    <i>E.g. solve $$\frac{dx}{dt} + 2tx = t$$ subject to $x = 1$ when $t=0.$</i>
</p>
<p>
    Multiply both sides by $e^{t^2}$:

    \begin{align*}
    e^{t^2} \frac{dx}{dt} + e^{t^2} 2tx &= e^{t^2} t \\
    \frac{d}{dt} (e^{t^2} x) &= e^{t^2} t \\
    e^{t^2} x &= \int e^{t^2} t dt \\
              &= \frac{e^{t^2}}{2} + c. \\
    \end{align*}

    Apply initial condition to find 

    $$c = 1/2,$$

    and 

    $$x = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{e^{-t^2}}{2}.$$
</p>

<h3>Solving a first order nonlinear separable equation</h3>

<p>
    <b>Ex.</b> <i>Solve $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x^2}{1 + t}$$ subject to $x = 1$ when $t = 0.$</i>
</p>

<p>
    A first order nonlinear equation is called separable if it has the form 

    $$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t) = g(x) h(t).$$ Then we can write 

    \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{g(x)} \frac{dx}{dt} &= h(t) \\
    \int \frac{1}{g(x)} dx &= \int h(t) dt. \\
    \end{align*}

    All that's left is to calculate these integrals, which in this case we can:

    \begin{align*}
    \int \frac{1}{x^2} dx &= \int \frac{1}{1 + t} dt \\
    x &= \frac{1}{c - \log(1 + t)}. \\
    \end{align*}

    Apply initial conditions to get

    $$x = \frac{1}{1 - \log(1 + t)}.$$
</p>

<h3>Solving a second order linear homogeneous equation knowing one solution</h3>

<p>
    <i>Ex. Consider the equation

        $$a \ddot x + b \dot x + cx = 0,$$

        where $a, b, c$ are known functions of $t.$ Suppose that we have found
        one solution, say $x = x_1(t),$ but have difficulty finding another.
        Show that by writing $x = x_1(t) u(t)$ we may reduce the equation to a
        first order problem for the variable $z = \dot u.$ Use this method to
        solve 

        $$\ddot x - 2 \dot x + x = 0$$ 

        subject to $x = 1, \dot x = 0$ when $t = 0.$
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    Suppose that the second solution $x$ of this equation may be written in the
    form $x = x_1(t) u(t)$ for some $u$ (it might not). Then we can find $\dot
    x$ and $\ddot x$:

    \begin{align*}
        \dot x &= \dot x_1 u + x_1 \dot u \\
        \ddot x &= \ddot x_1 u + 2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u.
    \end{align*}

    Substituting these into the differential equation, we get

    \begin{align*}
    0 &= a \ddot x + b \dot x + cx \\
    &= a (\ddot x_1 u + 2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u) + b(\dot x_1 u + x_1 \dot u) + c x_1 u \\
    &= (a \ddot x_1 + b \dot x_1 + c x_1) u + a (2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u) + b x_1 \dot u \\
    &= a (2 \dot x_1 \dot u + x_1 \ddot u) + b x_1 \dot u \\
    &= a x_1 \ddot u + (a 2 \dot x_1 + b x_1) \dot u \\
    &= a x_1 \dot z + (a 2 \dot x_1 + b x_1) z. \\
    \end{align*}

    Depending on what $x_1$ is, this equation may easily be solved.
</p>
<p>
    Applying this method to 

    $$\ddot x - 2 \dot x + x = 0,$$     

    we want to solve

    \begin{align*}
    0 &= a x_1 \dot z + (a 2 \dot x_1 + b x_1) z \\
    &= e^t \dot z + (2 e^t - 2 e^t) z \\
    &= e^t \dot z.
    \end{align*}

    Therefore $z = k$ and $u(t) = kt$ for some constant $k.$ Finally, 

    $$x = x_1(t) u(t) = k e^t t$$

    is the second solution.
</p>
<p>
    <i>A common theme in solving higher order differential equations is to
    reduce them to lower order equations that we know how to solve. Also a
    common problem solving technique.</i>
</p>

<h3>Nonhomogeneous second order linear equation</h3>

<p>
    <i>Ex. Solve $$\ddot x - x = t$$ s.t. $x = 1, \dot x = 0$ when $t = 0.$</i>
</p>
<p>
    We can solve a nonhomogeneous equation by finding (guessing) a particular
    solution, and adding it to the general solution of the homogeneous eq.
    In this case a particular solution is 
    
    $$x_1 = e^t - t.$$

    The general solution to the homogeneous eq is known to be 

    $$x = C e^t + D e^{-t}.$$

    Therefore the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is 

    $$x = C e^t + D e^{-t} + e^t - t.$$ 

    Applying initial conditions we find that $C = D = 0,$ so the solution is 

    $$x = e^t - t.$$

    (We could've skipped all this by noting that $x_1$ satisfied the initial
    conditions as soon as we found it.)
</p>

<h3>Simple harmonic motion</h3>

<p>
    Let 

    $$m \ddot x + \a x = 0$$ 

    be the equation of motion for a linear spring with $x = x_0, \dot x = 0$
    when $t = 0.$ (this can be derived using Newton and Hooke's law). Following
    discussion in the book we have 

    $$\pm \int_{x_0}^{x} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{\frac{\a}{m}(x_0^2 - x^2)}} = t.$$

    The integral can be found by substituting $\sin \theta = x$ to get

    $$x = x_0 \sin(\sqrt{\tfrac{\a}{m}} t + \tfrac{\pi}{2}).$$

    Using a sum of sine formula, we get

    $$x = x_0 \cos \sqrt{\tfrac{\a}{m}} t.$$
