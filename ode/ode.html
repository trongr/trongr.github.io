<h1>Differential Equations</h1>

<img src="images/tumblr_o6goow949B1rtjm0mo1_500.gif">
<p class="quote">The results of mathematics are seldom directly
applied; it is the definitions that are really useful. Once you learn
the concept of a differential equation, you see differential equations
all over, no matter what you do. This you cannot see unless you take a
course in abstract differential equations. What applies is the
cultural background you get from a course in differential equations,
not the specific theorems. If you want to learn French, you have to
live the life of France, not just memorize thousands of words. If you
want to apply mathematics, you have to live the life of differential
equations. When you live this life, you can then go back to molecular
biology with a new set of eyes that will see things you could not
otherwise see.</p><hr>

    That's because first-order objects (things) are simpler and
    therefore easier to use than second-order objects (relations
    between things). E.g. it's easier to use a hammer than to apply
    Maslow's Law of the Instrument.

    No. Reminds me of another puzzle where you walk up a mountain at
    dawn one day, and the next day also at dawn you walk
    down. Question is whether at some point on the second day you'll
    be at the same place at the same time as on the first day. Answer
    is Yes.

<h3>Model of a falling object</h3>

<div class="bside">
    Direction / slope field. Equilibrium solution corresponds to
    terminal velocity.

    <b>Example.</b> By Newton's second law,

    $$F = ma = m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - \g v,$$

    where $\g v$ is an approximation of the force due to air drag.

<h3>Simple model of population growth</h3>

<div class="bside">
    $r = 0.5, d = 450.$
    <img src="images/fieldmice.png">
</div>
<p>
    <b>Example.</b> Let $p$ be a mice population, $r$ be the constant
    growth rate, and $d$ be the constant number of deaths due to owls
    per unit time (e.g. month):

    $$\dot p = rp - d.$$
